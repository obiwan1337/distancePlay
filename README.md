This web application aims to take screenshots of Magic the gathering cards via the webcam of your PC/Laptop. 
The Text of the card you clicked on is supposed to be read and appear in digitalized form to be used as a search. 
This might take quite some time as the process is not optimized at all.
*nor does it work yet*
